# Repo with the scripts i created or modified to correspond with my usage.

- **Reddit VO** : Remove ?tl from reddit link since search engine now provide reddit link with this if you search info in your language
- **Animelist to anilist** : Redirect MAL manga/anime page directly to the Anilist equivalent 
- **Anilist to Anilist** : Redirect Anilist.co manga/anime page directly to the MAL equivalent

*PS : Do not use both Anilist/MAL script as it's useless and i'm not sure what it will do.*
